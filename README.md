# Getting Started with Meta-butter robot

Go to [Meta-butter robot](http://marcosmiani.github.io/meta-butter-robot).

## Things I would improve

 - Better search and better API (map it so the user can search more stuff)
 - Avoid local state if possible (better search params)
 - Link everything together, maps to different details (what other characters this episode, dimention, location has?)
 - MORE fun references to episodes and jokes

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
